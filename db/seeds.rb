Report.create(title: "Ben and Jerries Ice Cream", business: "Key Food", location: "60 St. Michael's Place", content: "My girlfriend and I were rollerblading at around 10pm. We went to the Flatbush Food Coop but had little success. A few blocks south there is a supermarket that throws away perfectly good food at closing time: around 11pm. We scored 10 cartons of Ben and Jerries and because it was late not many people took pictures of us!", date: "2016-08-21", borough_id: 3)

Some of the food is expired by a few days or weeks but it is still in good condition. We hit the jackpot with about 20 bars of vegan dark chocolate made in Chile.

Report.create(title: "Makeup Madness!", business: "Sephora", location: "Herald Square, NY, NY", content: "This was the easiest dive ever! I was shopping at Sephora and employees began filling up barbage bags right in front of me. It wasn't the most professional thing I've ever seen but whatever. I followed them outside and swan dived into the garbage. I scored $200 worth of makeup. I will never be ugly again!", date: "2016-08-21", borough_id: 3)

Report.create(title: "Found Books", business: "Strand Bookstore", location: "Union Sq. NY, NY", content: "Everybody knows that Strand has the discount books section in front of their store at all times.

Report.create(title: "Organic Cashews", business: "Flatbush Food Coop", location: "232 Mongoose Lane", content: "This dive will require guts and is of a legally dubious nature. List of items required: wirecutters, sodering iron, bolt-cutters, balls of steel. When the pitbulls finish their rounds cut through the outer fence. You will then need to use the sodering iron to cut a cut a hole in the next fence. Finally, you will see a gold dumpster up ahead. Use the bolt-cutters and you will be rewarded by an entire dumpster filled with Organic Icelandic cashews. I wasn't aware that cashews grew in Iceland, but I guess you learn something new every day!", date: "2016-08-21", borough_id: 1)

Report.create(title: "Panoply of Pitas", business: "Damascus Bakeries", location: "121 Eastern Ave, Brooklyn Bridge", content: "The pita goldmine is right outside the back entrance of this bakery.
